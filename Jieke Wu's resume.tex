  \begin{itemize}
    \item This study established an improved in vitro culture system for \textit{Akkermansia muciniphila} (Akk), simplifying and enhancing the user-friendliness compared to previous systems, while also eliminating \textit{Cutibacterium acnes} contamination.
    \item We successfully isolated and purified Akk-targeting phages from wastewater, facilitating the development of a phage library for gut microbiome research.
    \item The constructed phage library enables targeted Akk knockdown or knockout, advancing our understanding of Akk's role in gut-related diseases and providing a technological platform for future gut microbiota studies.
    % \item The potential to extend this approach to other gut microbiota signifies the broader applicability of our phage technology in microbiome research.
    \item This project was rated as an excellent school-level project that year.
